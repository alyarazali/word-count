# word-count (Custom WordPress Plugin)
Followed a tutorial to create a plugin that adds word count infos to the frontend (Posts only).

I then modified the code to allow admin to have the option to display on Post, Page(post type) or both.

![Backend](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47201621/152500432-284ef0fe-f7e6-4f37-932d-118be99a1f08.png)

I know it's not suitable to add word count info to the page(post type).

I was just experimenting and trying to learn & find out if I can do it.
